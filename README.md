Spam Email Detector
This is a simple machine learning project that detects whether an email (or SMS message) is spam or not.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a basic machine learning model.

Features
Classifies messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam" (Ham).

Trained on a real SMS Spam dataset.

Uses TF-IDF Vectorization and Naive Bayes classification.

Technologies Used
Python 3

Pandas

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Harita27/spam-email-detector.git

Navigate into the project folder:

cd spam-email-detector

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python file:

python spam_detector.py

Dataset
SMS Spam Collection from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Future Improvements
Build a web app using Flask.

Add text cleaning techniques (like stemming or lemmatization).

Try different machine learning algorithms or deep learning models.
